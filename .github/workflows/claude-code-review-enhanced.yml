            # CONTEXT: FastAPI + Vercel Serverless Backend
            This is a minimal serverless FastAPI backend with:
            - Single endpoint: POST /api/chat
            - OpenAI gpt-4o-mini integration
            - No database, stateless design
            - Deployment: Vercel Serverless Functions

            Review standards: See .github/REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md for complete details.

            # PHASE 1: Current State Validation

            Analyze the PR diff against these architecture patterns:

            ## Architecture Validation
            - OpenAI client initialized ONCE at module level (correct pattern for reuse)
            - Lifespan handler validates config but WARNS, doesn't raise exceptions (serverless compatibility)
            - No database/state management (stateless design)
            - Environment variables: OPENAI_API_KEY, ALLOWED_ORIGINS, ENVIRONMENT

            ## API Design Validation
            - Pydantic BaseModel for request/response (ChatRequest, ChatResponse)
            - HTTPException with fastapi.status codes (not raw integers)
            - CORS middleware with SPECIFIC origins (not wildcard ["*"])
            - OpenAPI metadata: summary, description, responses dict
            - Field validators: min_length, max_length constraints

            ## OpenAI Integration Validation
            - Direct OpenAI SDK usage (no frameworks)
            - Error handling: RateLimitError → 429, APIConnectionError → 503, APIError → 500
            - Single client instance reused (not recreated per request)
            - Model: gpt-4o-mini (cost awareness)

            ## Security Validation
            - No hardcoded OPENAI_API_KEY in code
            - CORS allows SPECIFIC origins only (not ["*"])
            - API docs disabled in production (ENVIRONMENT=production)
            - No .env files committed
            - Lifespan handler warns, doesn't crash

            ## Deployment Validation (Vercel Serverless)
            - requirements.txt = production deps ONLY (test deps in pyproject.toml)
            - Lifespan handler compatible with cold starts (warns, doesn't raise)
            - vercel.json routes to /api/index.py

            ---

            # PHASE 2: Gap Analysis (ONLY NEW ISSUES)

            Based on Phase 1 validation, identify ONLY items that:
            1. Are MISSING (don't exist at all)
            2. Are INCORRECT (exist but implemented wrong)
            3. Create SECURITY RISKS

            DO NOT re-flag items that passed Phase 1 validation.

            ## Anti-Circular Prevention Rules:

            ❌ DO NOT suggest adding lifespan handler if it already exists
            ❌ DO NOT flag module-level OpenAI client init as a problem (it's correct)
            ❌ DO NOT recommend adding test deps to requirements.txt (they belong in pyproject.toml)
            ❌ DO NOT suggest removing lifespan for serverless (Vercel supports it since 2024)
            ❌ DO NOT re-validate items from Phase 1 that passed

            ## Gap Categories:

            **Missing Components:**
            - Response models not defined
            - OpenAPI metadata missing
            - Error handling incomplete
            - Type hints missing

            **Code Quality Issues:**
            - Hardcoded values
            - print() instead of logging
            - Missing type hints
            - Bare exception catches

            **Security Gaps:**
            - Wildcard CORS (allows API abuse)
            - Hardcoded secrets
            - Public API docs in production
            - Missing environment validation

            **Deployment Issues:**
            - Test deps in requirements.txt (wrong)
            - RuntimeError in lifespan (breaks cold starts)
            - Missing vercel.json routing

            ---

            # PHASE 3: Recommendations (FORWARD-LOOKING ONLY)

            For gaps identified in Phase 2, create actionable recommendations.

            ## Recommendation Format:

            **Issue:** [Describe the gap from Phase 2]
            **Impact:** [Security/Reliability/Code Quality]
            **Fix:** [Specific code change with example]
            **Reference:** [Link to .github/REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md section or official docs]

            ## Example Recommendation:

            **Issue:** CORS configuration uses wildcard origins
            **Impact:** SECURITY - Allows any website to call backend and consume OpenAI credits
            **Fix:**
            ```python
            allowed_origins_env = os.getenv("ALLOWED_ORIGINS")
            if not allowed_origins_env:
                allowed_origins = ["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:5173"]
            else:
                allowed_origins = allowed_origins_env.split(",")

            app.add_middleware(
                CORSMiddleware,
                allow_origins=allowed_origins,  # Specific origins only
                allow_credentials=False,
                ...
            )
            ```
